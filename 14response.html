        <h1>Coordination & Response</h1>
        <p> Author: <a href="about.html#contribution"> Ms. Joey Lie (EI)</a></p>
        <h2>The Nervous System</h2>
          <ul class='outer'>
            <li>Brain & Spinal Cord (CentralNervousSystem)
              <ul>
                <li>Brain - It is full of relay neurone. It's primary function is coordinate how a certain action will produce a reaction. It processes input from the sensory neurone and find an appropiate response which will be transmitted to the motor neurone.</li>
                <li>Spinal Cord - Is full of all types of neurone. It is like the highway road of a city. It passes impulse to other neurones, from and to the brain and peripheral nerves.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Nerves (neuron; PeripheralNervousSystem)
              <ul>
                <li>Sensory - this is a neuron used to detect changes in the environment.</li>
                <li>Relay - this are found between the sensory neuron and the motor neuron. These type of neuron is usually in the brain to process and communicate the electrical impulse sent by the sensory neurone </li>
                <li>Motor - this neuron is usually found in spinal cord. It generally controls muscle movements, glands, organs, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Key Terms
              <ul>
                <li>Stimuli - Sense organs – groups of receptor cells responding to specific stimuli : light, sound, touch, temperature and chemicals.</li>
                <li>Effectors -  effectors are usually glands, muscles, organs. They are usually linked to motor nerves to produce a response</li>
                <li>Relflex Arc - If you get touch a hot material, your sensory nerve recognizes this and will sent and  impulse. But this time, the impulse does not go all the way to your brain and back to your hands, in instead, is processed in the spinal cord for faster processing. This is the reflex arc. Reflex action is very useful because the message gets from the receptor to the effector as quickly as possible. The pathway along which the nerve impulse passes – the sensory neurone, relay neurone and motor neurone – is called a reflex arc. Reflex actions are examples of involuntary actions (not under conscious control).</li>
                <li>Synapses
                  <ul>
                    <li>A junction between two nerve cells, consisting a minute gap across which impulses pass by diffusion of a neurotransmitter.</li>
                    <li>There is a small gap between neurons. These gaps are called synaptic clefts. The ends of the two neurons on either side of the cleft plus the cleft itself is called a synapse.</li>
                    <li>Inside the sensory neurone’s axon are hundreds of tiny vacuoles, or vesicles. These each contain a chemical called a transmitter substance or neurotransmitter.</li>
                    <li>When an impulse arrives along the axon of the sensory neurone, it causes these vesicles to move to the cell membrane and empty their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter quickly diffuses across the tiny gap and attaches to receptor molecules in the cell membrane of the relay neurone. This can happen because the shape of the neurotransmitter molecules is complementary to the shape of the receptor molecules.</li>
                    <li>The binding of the neurotransmitter with the receptors triggers a nerve impulse in the relay neurone. This impulse sweeps along the relay neurone, until it reaches the next synapse. Here, a similar process occurs to transmit the impulse to the motor neurone.</li>
                    <li>Synapses act like one – way valves. There is only neurotransmitter on one side of the synapse, so impulses can only go across from that side. </li>
                    <li>Synapses ensure that nerve impulses only travel in one direction.</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        <h2>The Endocrine System</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
          <li>The endocrine system is a group of hormone-glands controlling the growth, metabolism, and homeostasis of the body</li>
        </ul>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Gland</th>
              <th>Description</th>
              <th>Hormone</th>

              <td>It is found in the top of the kidneys</td>
              <td>Adrenaline</td>
              <td>Secretes adrenaline when excited, panic, nervous. This hormone's target organs is the heart, eyes, liver, and muscles. The effect is, faster heart beat, widened pupils, converts glycogen to glucose, tenses muscle. </td>

          <h3>Endocrine Vs Nervous System</h3>
          <ul class='outer'>
            <li>Endocrine transmit chemicals via blood while nervous transmit electrical impulses via nerves</li>
            <li>Endocrine has a slower transmission speed compared to nervous</li>
            <li>In endocrine, Hhormones are throughout the body, While in nervouse, an impulse is sent directly to the target organ</li>
            <li>Endocrine, long term effects. Nervous, short-lived effects</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Homeostasis</h2>
        <p>Homeostasis is the ability to maintant constant internal state despite external changes. If receptors senses that there is a change in stimuli, it will send impulse to the brain which will then produce an impulse for a effector/gland to produce an appropiate response</p>
        <ul class='outer'>
          <li>Blood Glucose Concentration
            <ul>
              <li>In order to maintain the right blood glucose concentration, homeostasis is required.</li>
              <li>If there is too much glucose in the blood, the pancrease will secrete insulin which will convert glucose to glycogen in the liver. This will cause the blood glucose concentration to lower down and return to stability</li>
              <li>If there is too little glucose, glucagon will be released and convert the glycogen in the liver to glucose. It will also decrease the respiration rate in cells so less glucose is used.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Temperature - Ezymes work best at 37ºC. It is important for the body to maintain this temperature for efficient rate of reaction
            <ul>
              <li>If internal temperature is low, muscles will contract and blood vessels will constrict (reducing surface and to move away from skin) to reduce heat loss</li>
              <li>If internal temperature is too high, the body will start sweating and blodd vessels will dilate, causing heat to dissipate faster.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Eye</h2>
        <h3>Composition of The Eye</h3>
        <ul class='outer'>
          <li>The Cornea - The cornea is responsible for most of the bending of the light, and it is also serves as a protection for the surface of the eye.</li>
          <li>Iris
            <ul>
              <li>In front of the lens is a circular piece of tissue called the iris.</li>
              <li>This is the coloured part of the eye. </li>
              <li>It contains pigments, which absorb light and stop it getting through the retina.</li>
              <li>In the middle of the iris is a gap called the pupil.</li>
              <li>The wider the pupil is, the more light can get through to the retina.</li>
              <li>In strong light, the iris closes in and makes the pupil small – this stop too much light getting in and damaging the retina.</li>
              <li>Circular muscles lie in circle around the pupil. When the circular muscles contract, they make the pupil constrict or get smaller.</li>
              <li>Radial muscles run outwards from the edge of the pupil. When they contract, they make the pupil dilate, or get larger.</li>
              <li>This is called the iris reflex (or sometimes the pupil reflex)</li>
              <li>The responses of the iris are examples of a reflex action.</li>
              <li>The response of the iris to light intensity (the stimulus) is fast and automatic.</li>
              <li>This reflex action prevents damage to the retina that could be caused by very bright light falling onto it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Pupil - This is where light enters. It will be bigger in dark light, and smaller in bright light.</li>
          <li>Lens - the lens makes adjustments so that we can see clearly</li>
          <li>Vireous Humour -  it is a transparent semipliquid that gives the eyeball its shape</li>
          <li>Retina
            <ul>
              <li>Behind the retina is a black layer called the choroid. The choroid absorbs all the light after it has been through the retina, so it does not get scattered around the inside of the eye. The choroid is also rich in blood vessels which nourish the eye.</li>
              <li>There are no receptor cells where the optic nerve leaves the retina. This part is called the blind spot. If light falls on this place, no impulses will be sent to the brain.</li>
              <li>The part of the retina where the receptor cells are packed most closely together is called the fovea. This is the part of the retina where light is focused when you look straight at an object.</li>
              <li>The closer together the receptor cells are, the clearer the image the brain will get.</li>
              <li>Some of these receptor cells are sensitive to light of different colours, enabling us to see coloured images.</li>
              <li>The brain sorts out all the impulses from each receptor cell, and builds up an image.</li>
              <li>The retina is at the back of the eye. When light falls on a receptor cell in the retina, the cell sends an electrical impulse along the optic nerve to the brain.</li>
              <li>There are two kinds of receptor cells in the retina :
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Rod cells</strong> are sensitive to quite dim light, but do not respond to colour.&nbsp;Rod cells allow us to see in dim light but only in black and white while cones give us colour vision.</li>
                <li><strong>Cone cells</strong> are able to distinguish between different colours of light but they only function when the light is quite bright. There are three different kinds of cones, sensitive to red, green and blue light.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The fovea contains almost entirely cones, packed tightly together. When we look directly at an object, we use our cone to produce sharp image, in colour. Rod are found further out on the retina, and are less tightly packed. They show us a less detailed image.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Optic Nerve - is a sensory neurone that will send impulse to the brain</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How The Eye Works</h3>
        <ul class='outer'>
          <li>Focusing light
            <ul>
              <li>Light rays must be bent or refracted so that they focus exactly onto the retina so that we can see a clear image.</li>
              <li>The humours inside the eye are transparent and colourless so that light can pass through them easily. </li>
              <li>The cornea is responsible for most of the bending of the light. The lens makes fine adjustments.</li>
              <li>The image on the retina is upside down. The brain interprets this so that you see it the right way up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Adjusting The Focus
            <ul>
              <li>Light rays coming from an object in the distance will be almost parallel to one another. They will not need much bending.</li>
              <li>Light rays coming from a nearby object are going away from one another, or diverging. They will need to be bent inwards quite strongly.</li>
              <li>The shape of the lens can be adjusted to bend light more or less.</li>
              <li>The thicker the lens, the more it will bend the light rays.</li>
              <li>The thinner it is, the less it will bend them.</li>
              <li>This adjustment in the shape of the lens to focus light coming from different distances is called accomodation.</li>
              <li>The lens is held in the position by a ring of suspensory ligaments.</li>
              <li>The tension on the suspensory ligaments, and thus the shape of the lens, is altered by means of the ciliary muscle. </li>
              <li>When the cilliary muscle contracts, the suspensory ligaments are loosened.</li>
              <li>When it relaxes, they are pulled thight. When the suspensory ligaments are tight, the lens is pulled thin. When they are loosened, the lens gets thicker.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
