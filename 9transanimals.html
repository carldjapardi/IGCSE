        <h1>Transport in animals</h1>
        <p> Author: <a href="about.html#contribution"> Ms. Joey Lie (EI)</a></p>
        <h2>1. Circulatory systems</h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>The circulatory system of all mammals consists of blood vessels, the heart and blood.</li>
            <li>Valves in the heart and blood vessels make sure the blood flows in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Double and single circulatory system
              <ul>
                <li>In animals with lungs, blood flows through the heart twice before it completes one circuit. This is known as <strong>double circulation</strong>.</li>
                <li>The double circulation consists of the <strong>pulmonary circulation </strong>and <strong>systemic circulation.</strong></li>
                <li>The pulmonary circulation transports blood between the heart and lungs. Pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. Oxygenated blood goes back to the heart via the pulmonary veins.</li>
                <li>The systemic circulation transport blood between the heart and other parts of the body. Oxygenated blood leaves the heart via the aorta and is carried by the arteries to all parts of the blood (except the lungs). The deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The advantages of a double circulation :
              <ul>
                <li>It allows blood to enter the lungs at a lower pressure than that of the systemic circulation.</li>
                <li>The blood that enters the systemic circulation is at a higher pressure than the blood going to the lungs. Oxygenated blood is distributed more quickly to the body tissues.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>2. The Heart</h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>The heart has four chamber.
              <ul>
                <li>The upper two smaller chambers are called atria (atrium)
                  <ul>
                    <li>Atria receive blood from the veins</li>
                    <li>The muscular walls of the atria are much thinner than those of the ventricles, as the atria only have to pump blood into the ventricles</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The lower two chambers are called ventricles.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ventricles pump blood into the arteries.</li>
                    <li>Ventricles have thick muscular walls because they have to force blood out of the heart to the whole body, which require high pressure.</li>
                    <li>The wall of right ventricle is thinner than that of the left ventricle because the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs only, which requires less pressure.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The right and left sides of the heart are separated by a muscular wall called the septum. This ensures that the deoxygenated blood in the right side does not mix with the oxygenated blood in the left.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Flow of blood through the heart :
              <ul>
                  <li>Deoxygenated blood from various part of the body enters the right atrium.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Blood from the head, neck and arms return via superior vena cava.</li>
                      <li>Blood from other parts of the body (except lungs) return via inferior vena cava.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The blood is pushed into the right ventricle by the contraction of the right atrium.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Between the right atrium and ventricle lies the tricuspid valve, which consists of three flaps that are attached to the walls of the right ventricle by tendons called the chordae tendinae.</li>
                      <li>The tricuspid valve opens to let blood through into the ventricle.</li>
                      <li>The semi &ndash; lunar valves in the pulmonary arch close to prevent backflow of blood into the right ventricle.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The deoxygenated blood is then pump from the right ventricle into the pulmonary arch and then into the lung.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The tricuspid valve closes to prevent blood from being pumped back into the right atrium.</li>
                      <li>The semi &ndash; lunar valves in the pulmonary arch open to let blood through.</li>
                      <li>Blood flows to each lung through the two pulmonary arteries, which branch from the pulmonary arch.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the left atrium via pulmonary veins.</li>
                  <li>The oxygenated blood is pumped into the left ventricle by the left atrium.
                    <ul>
                      <li>As in the right side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle are separated by a valve. This valve consists of two flaps, and hence is called the bicuspid or mitral valve.</li>
                      <li>The bicuspid valve opens to allow blood flow into the left ventricle.</li>
                      <li>The semi &ndash; lunar valves in the aortic arch close to prevent backflow of blood into the left ventricle.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is pumped into the aortic arch and then to the rest of the body (except the lungs)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Heart beat
                <ul>
                  <li>Most people&rsquo;s hearts beat about 60 to70 times a minute when they are resting.</li>
                  <li>A pulse is caused by the expansion and relaxation of an artery, caused by the heart pushing blood through it.</li>
                  <li>Pulse rate is therefore the same as heart rate.</li>
                  <li>Two suitable places to find a pulse are inside your wrist and just to the side of the big tendons in your neck.</li>
                  <li>When a person exercises, their heart beats faster. Their muscles are using up oxygen more quickly in respiration, to supply energy needed for movement.</li>
                  <li>A faster heart rate means faster delivery of blood to the muscles, providing oxygen.</li>
                  <li>The rate at which the heart beats is controlled by a patch of muscle in the right atrium called the pacemaker.</li>
                  <li>The pacemaker sends electrical signals through the walls of the heart at regular intervals, which make the muscle contract.</li>
                  <li>The pacemaker&rsquo;s rate and therefore the rate of heart beat, changes according to the needs of the body. For example, during exercise, the brain sends impulses along nerves to the pacemaker, to make the heart beat faster.</li>
                  <li>When the respiration rate increases, more carbon dioxide is produced and dissolves in the blood. A weak acid is formed, lowering the pH of the blood. Receptor cells in the brain sense this drop in pH and this triggers an increase in the frequency of the nerve impulse sent to the pacemakers.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Valves in the heart
                <ul>
                  <li>The heart beats as the cardiac muscles in its walls contract and relax.</li>
                  <li>When they contract, the heart becomes smaller, squeezing blood out. This is called <strong>systole</strong>.</li>
                  <li>When they relax, the heart becomes larger, allowing blood to flow into the atria and ventricles. This is called <strong>diastole</strong>.</li>
                  <li>A valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle and another between the right atrium and ventricle are called atrioventricular valves &ndash; bicuspid valve (mitral valve) and tricuspid valve.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
          <li>Treating CHD
            <ul>
            <li>Drugs (statin and aspirin) and lifestyle changes - aspirin is to decrease the risk of blood clots forming inside blood vessels</li>
            <li>Coronary bypass operation - A blocked or damaged coronary artery can be replaced with a length of blood vessel taken from another part of the body.</li>
            <li>Stent - Insert a little mesh tube, a stent, inside the artery to keep it open.</li>
            <li>Angioplasty - Use a tiny baloon. It is inserted into the collapsed artery and then inflated using water. This pushes the artery open. The balloon is then removed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Coronary arteries supply heart muscle
            <ul>
            <li>The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscles.</li>
            <li>If a coronary artery gets blocked &ndash; for example by a blood clot &ndash; the cardiac muscles run short of oxygen. They cannot obtain energy to allow them to contract. The heart therefore stops beating. This is called a heart attack or cardiac arrest.</li>
            <li>Blockage of the coronary arteries is called coronary heart disease.</li>
            <li>Several risk factors that increase a person&rsquo;s risk of getting coronary heart disease.
              <ul>
                <li>Smoking cigarettes</li>
                <li>Diet : high in salt, saturated fat or cholesterol</li>
                <li>Obesity</li>
                <li>Stress</li>
                <li>Genes</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
        <h2>3. Blood vessels</h2>
          <ul class="outer" style="padding-bottom:35px">
            <li>Three main kinds of blood vessels : <strong>arteries, capillaries and veins</strong>.</li>
            <li>Arteries carry blood away from the heart. They divide again and again, and eventually form very tiny vessels called capillaries.</li>
            <li>The capillaries gradually join up with one another to form large vessels called veins.</li>
            <li>Veins carry blood towards the heart</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>4. Blood</h2>
          <ul class="outer" style="padding-bottom:35px">
            <li>The <strong>liquid</strong> part of blood is called <strong>plasma</strong>.</li>
            <li>Plasma is mostly water. Soluble nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and mineral ions are carried in the plasma.</li>
            <li>Plasma also transports hormones and carbon dioxide.</li>
            <li>Floating in the plasma are <strong>cells</strong> &ndash; red blood cell, white blood cells and platelets.</li>
            <li>Phagocytes will collect at the site of damage to engulf and digest any microorsganisms which might possibly get in.</li>
            <li>Platelets - Normally, blood vessel walls are very smooth. When a blood vessel is cut, the platelets bump into the rough edges of the cut and react by releasing a chemical. The damaged tissues around the blood vessel also release chemicals. In the blood plasma, there is a soluble protein called fibrinogen. The chemicals released by the platelets and the damaged tissues set off a chain of reactions, which cause the fibrinogen to change into fibrin. Fibrin is insoluble. If forms fibres. These form a mesh across the wound. Red blood cells and platelets get trapped in the tangle of fibrin fibres, forming a blood clot.</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>5. Lymph and tissue fluid</h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>Capillaries leak. The cells in their walls do not fit together exactly, so there are small gaps between them.</li>
            <li>White blood cells can get through these gaps. They are able to move and can squeeze through, out of the capillaries.</li>
            <li>Red blood cells cannot get out. They are too large and cannot change their shape very much.</li>
            <li>Plasma and white blood cells are continually leaking out of the blood capillaries.</li>
            <li>The fluid formed is called tissue fluid. It surrounds all the cells in the body.</li>
