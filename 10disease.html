        <h1>Pathogens and Immunity</h1>
        <p> Author: <a href="about.html#author1"> Ms. Joey Lie (EI)</a></p>
        <h2>Pathogens</h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>A pathogen is a microorganism that cause disease.</li>
            <li>Type of pathogen :
              <ul>
                <li>viruses : influenza, common cold, poliomyelitis, AIDS.</li>
                <li>bacteria : cholera, syphilis, whooping cough, tuberculosis, tetanus.</li>
                <li>protoctists : malaria, amoebic dysentery.</li>
                <li>fungi : athlete&rsquo;s foot, ringworm.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Diseases that are caused by pathogens can usually be passed from one person to another. They are called transmissible diseases.</li>
            <li>Some pathogens may damage cells by living in them and using up their resources, others cause harm to cells and body system by producing waste products called toxins which spread around the body and cause symptoms such as high temperature and rashes.</li>
            <li>There are several ways in which pathogens can get into our body :
              <ul>
                <li>Direct contact
                  <ul>
                    <li>The passing of a pathogen to an uninfected person is called transmission.</li>
                    <li>The entry of pathogen into the body is known as infection.</li>
                    <li>The person of animal in which the pathogen lives and breeds is said to be a host for that pathogen.</li>
                    <li>Some pathogens pass from one person to another when there is direct contact between an infected person and uninfected one.</li>
                    <li>Disease transmitted like this are sometimes known as contagious diseases.</li>
                    <li>For example, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) can be transmitted when an infected person&rsquo;s blood comes into contact with another person&rsquo;s blood. The fungus that causes the skin infection, the athlete&rsquo;s foot can be passed on by sharing a towel with infected person.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Indirect transmission
                  <ul>
                    <li>Through the respiratory passages. Cold and influenza viruses are carried in the air in tiny droplets of moisture. When someone with these illnesses speaks, coughs or sneezes, millions of viruses are propelled into the air. If the droplets are breathed in, the person may become infected.</li>
                    <li>In food or water. Bacteria such as Salmonella can enter the alimentary canal with the food that you eat. Cooking usually destroys bacteria, so eating recently cooked food is generally safe. Many pathogens including the virus that causes poliomyelitis and the bacterium that causes cholera, are transmitted in water. Swimming in the water that contains these pathogens or drinking water containing them increase the risk of catching these diseases.</li>
                    <li>By vectors. A vector is an organism that carries pathogen from one host to another. Dogs, racoons, skunks and bats are vectors for the rabies virus which is transmitted in their saliva when they bite. Anopheles mosquitoes are the vector for malaria. The female mosquitoes may have the protocist pathogen Plasmodium in their saliva, which they inject into your blood when they bite.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Body defences</h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>Mechanical barriers
              <ul>
              <li>The nostrils contain hairs that help to trap dust that might be carrying pathogens.</li>
              <li>The skin has a thick outer layer of dead cells, containing a protein called keratin, that is very difficult to penetrate.</li>
              <li>When skin is cut, blood clots seal the wound which prevents the blood loss and prevents pathogens from getting into the blood through the cut.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Chemical barriers
              <ul>
              <li>The lining of the alimentary canal and the respiratory system produce sticky mucus which can trap pathogens.</li>
              <li>In the respiratory passages, cilia then sweep the mucus back up to the throat, where it can be swallowed.</li>
              <li>In stomach, hydrochloric acid, a strong acid, is secreted. This may kill bacteria in the food.</li>
              <li>Pathogens that manage to get through all of these defences are usually destroyed by white blood cells.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
              <li>Some of these cells take in and digest pathogens by phagocytosis, while others produce chemicals called antibodies that incapacitate or directly kill the pathogens.</li>
              <li>Vaccination against a particular disease helps antibodies to be produced very quickly if a person is infected by the pathogen that causes it.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The fight against disease has three levels :
              <ol>
              <li>personal &ndash; for example, each individual can take responsibility for his or her own social habits.</li>
              <li>community &ndash; for example local health services.</li>
              <li>worldwide &ndash; for example many nations carry out vaccination</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Food hygiene
              <ul>
              <li>Most food poisoning is caused by bacteria.</li>
              <li>Rules to prevent food poisioning :
                <ol>
                  <li>Keep bacteria and virus away from food &ndash; always wash hands before touching or eating food, or putting hands into mouth for any reason. Keep your hair out of food. Never cough or sneeze over food.</li>
                  <li>Keep animal away from food. Houseflies usually have harmful bacteria on their feet, as they may have walking on rubbish, faeces or dead animals. Moreover, when they spit saliva onto the food. Rats and mice often carry pathogens. Always cover food to keep flies and other animals from touching it.</li>
                  <li>Do not keep food at room temperature for long periods. Keeping food in the fridge will slow down bacterial growth. Cooking it at a high temperature will kill most bacteria. If cooked food is reheated, it should be made really hot, not just warmed.</li>
                  <li>Keep raw meet away from other foods. Raw meat often contains bacteria. This is not a problem if the meat is to be cooked as these bacteria will be killed. However, if the bacteria get onto other foods that might be eaten raw, then they might breed there. Food such as salads and vegetables that are to be eaten raw should be washed in clean water before eating, unless they have been packaged so that they cannot be contaminated with bacteria.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Personal hygiene
                <ul>
                <li>Personal hygiene meas keeping your body clean to reduce the risk of getting or passing on transmissible diseases.</li>
                <li>If oil, dirt and sweat are left on the skin for long, they provide breeding grounds for bacteria. These can produce substance that smell unpleasant. It can be prevented by washing regularly using soap and shampoo.</li>
                <li>Brushing teeth twice a day, and perhaps also using a mouthwash, can keep harmful bacteria under control.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Waste disposal
                <ul>
                <li>Animals such as houseflies, rats and stray dogs forage for food in the rubbish<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Bacteria breed in the waste food. Dangerous chemicals seep out of the rubbish, polluting the ground and waterways.</li>
                <li>Landfill sites can be absolutely safe if they are properly managed.</li>
                <li>Some of the rubbish in the landfill site is rotted by decomposers, especially bacteria. This produces a gas methane which is flammable and could cause explosions if it is allowed build up.</li>
                <li>Placing pipes in the rubbish can allow the methane gas to escape harmlessly into the air.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Methane can be collected and used as fuel.</li>
                <li>Eventually, when the landfill site is full, it can be covered over with soil and grass and tress allowed to grow.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Sewage treatment
                <ul>
                <li>Sewage is waste liquid come from houses, industry and other parts of villages, town and cities.</li>
                <li>Sewage is mostly water, but also contains many other substances include urine and faeces, toilet paper, detergents, oil and many other chemicals.</li>
                <li>Sewage should not be allowed to run into rivers or the sea before it has been treated because it can harm people and the environment.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Untreated sewage (raw sewage) contains many bacteria and other organisms, some are likely to be pathogens.</li>
                <li>Poliomyelitis and cholera are two of the serious disease that can be transmitted through water polluted with raw sewage.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

        <h2>The immune system</h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>Antibodies
              <ul>
                <li>An antibody is a protein produced by the body in the response to an antigen.</li>
                <li>Antibodies are made by white blood cells called lymphocytes.</li>
                <li>Each kind of lymphocyte is able to produce different sort of antibody.</li>
                <li>To destroy a particular pathogen, antibody molecules must be made which are just the right shape to fit into molecules on the outside of the pathogen. These pathogen molecules are called antigens.</li>
                <li>When antibody molecules lock onto the pathogen, they kill the pathogen.</li>
                <li>Lymphocytes are a very important part of your immune system. The way in which they respond to pathogens, by producing antibodies is called the immune response.</li>
                <li>Several ways to kill the pathogen :
                  <ul>
                    <li>To alert phagocytes to the presence of the pathogens so that the phagocytes will come and destroy them. Or the antibodies may start off a series of reactions in the blood which produce enzymes to digest the pathogens.</li>
                    <li>If a pathogen enters the body, one of the lymphocytes may recognise the pathogen as being something that its antibody can destroy. This lymphocyte will start to divide rapidly by mitosis, making a clone of lymphocytes just like itself. These lymphocytes then secrete their antibody, destroying the pathogen. This takes time. It may take a while for the &lsquo;right&rsquo; lymphocyte to recognise the pathogen and then a few days more for it t produce a big enough clone to make enough antibody to kill pathogen. In the meantime, the pathogen breeds, making ill. However, the lymphocytes get the upper hand and you get better.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Memory cells
              <ul>
              <li>When a lymphocyte clones itself, not all of the cells make antibodies. Some of them simply remain in the blood and other parts of the body living for a very long time. They are called memory cells.</li>
              <li>If the same kind of pathogen gets into the body again, these memory cells will be ready and kill the pathogens before they produce a large population and do any harm. The person has become immune to that type of pathogen.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Vaccination
              <ul>
                <li>In most countries, children or adults are given vaccinations.</li>
                <li>A vaccine contains weakened or dead viruses or bacteria that normally causes disease. These pathogens have the same antigen as the normal ones, but they are not able to cause disease.</li>
                <li>When these pathogens are introduced into the body, they are recognised by the lymphocytes that can make antibodies that will lock onto their antigens. These lymphocytes multiply and produce antibodies just as they would after a real infection. They also make memory cells, which give long-term immunity. If the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; viruses or bacteria get into the body one day, they will be attacked and destroyed immediately</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Controlling disease by vaccination
              <ul>
                <li>Smallpox is a serious, often fatal, disease caused by a virus and transmitted by direct contact.</li>
                <li>If a person survives smallpox, they are often left with badly scared skin and may be made blind.</li>
                <li>The WHO (World Health Organisation) had eliminated smallpox by a well coordinated vaccination programme.</li>
                <li>Poliomyelitis is a disease caused by a virus and leaves many people with permanent paralysis of part of their body.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Measles is spread by airborne droplets and causes a skin rash and fever,and there can be very severe complications, such as blindness and brain damage.</li>
                <li>The control of many serious infectious diseases relies on vaccination on children.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Active and passive immunity
              <ul>
                <li>Active immunity : defence against a pathogen by antibody production in the body.</li>
                <li>Active immunity is developed after contacting pathogens inside the body &ndash; by :
                  <ul>
                    <li>having the disease and getting over it</li>
                    <li>being vaccinated with weakened pathogens.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Passive immunity : short &ndash; term defece against a pathogen by antibodies acquired from another individual, such as from mother to infant.</li>
                <li>Passive immunity is the immunity provided by antibodies from outside the body &ndash; by :
                  <ul>
                    <li>breast feeding</li>
                    <li>injection of antibodies</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Active immunity can be very long; lasting or can last an entire lifetime.</li>
                <li>Passive immunity only lasts for a short time because the antibodies will eventually break down and no lymphocytes have been stimulated to make clones of themselves. The body has not made memory cells, so any infection will be treated as the first-time one.</li>
              </li>
            </ul>
              <li>Auto-immune diseases
                  <ul>
                    <li>Lymphocytes normally respond only to &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; cells that enter the body and they do not produce antibodies against our own cells.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
                    <li>Sometimes our lymphocytes behave as though some of our own cells are &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; and react to them as they would to an invasion of pathogen. Disease result from this malfunction of the immune system are called auto-immune disease. For example type 1 diabetes.</li>
                    <li>One of the hormone produced by beta cells of pancreas is insulin. Insulin is made when blood glucose concentration rises above normal, and it brings about events that cause the concentration to fall.</li>
                    <li>Type 1 diabetes happens when the cells of the immune system attack the beta cells and destroy them.</li>
                    <li>The loss of beta cells means that insulin is no longer produced so blood glucose concentration is not controlled and results in diabetes, in which blood glucose levels can fluctuate widely.</li>
                    <li>People with type 1 diabetes have to take insulin at regular intervals and take great care over what they eat to keep blood glucose concentration within normal limits.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
