        <h1>Human Nutrition</h1>
        <p>In order to survive, we have to eat food. But not just any food, we have to eat food that is in the right amount and with the right nutrition</p>
        <h2>Balance Diet</h2>
        <p>A balance diet encompasses all the necessary nutrition in the right proportion</p>
        <ul class="outer">
          <li>Carbohydrate
            <p>Carbohydrates is a source of energy and plays a vital role in our balance diet. It includes food such as rice, pasta, bread, and more. Like seen in chapter 4, carbohydrate will be broken down into glucose. This glucose is then use for respiration in our cells.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Protein
            <p>Protein is the builder in our body. When you consumer protein, it is digested and broken down into amino acids. Amino acids is used to make and repairs cells. It forms muscles, enzymes and also some hormones. It includes food such as meat, eggs, fish, etc.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Fats
            <p>Fats is used for insulation, emergency energy, protection, and more. It includes food such as butter, fatty meats, oil, etc. Fats are digested and broken down into fatty acids and glycerol.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Vitamins (C & D)
            <p>Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits and vegetabes. It plays a key role in building our skin, blood vessel and more. Vitamin D on the other hand is used to mantain strong bones and help with the uptake of calcium during digestion. It usually found it dairy products. </p>
          </li>
          <li>Fibre
            <p>Fibre prevents constipation. It is found in vegatables and fruits. Usually, the food are to difficult to digest and thus it allows the intestines to contract repetitively, aiding other food to move through smoothly.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Minerals (Calcium & Iron)
            <p>Calclium is need for healthy bones and teeth. It is usually found in dairy products such as milk and eggs. Iron is found in red meat, and some dark vegetabes. Iron is found in haemoglobin, it is important for tranporting blood around the body</p>
          </li>
          <li>Water
            <p>Water...Everyone's favourite drink. It is found it every cell of your body. Some of it's purposes are to act as a site for chemical reactions, maintaining body temperature, and more.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Food Enters (Digestive System)</h2>
        <ul class="outer">
          <li>Mouth. Our food starts in the journey in our mouth where our saliva (which contain the enzyme amylase) will break down carbohydrates into maltose. Mechanical digestion (chewing) also happens here.</li>
          <li>Oesophagus. Next, the food enters the oesophagus. The oesophagus connects the mouth and the stomach and its primary purpose is to mantain the amount of food in our stomach.</li>
          <li>Stomach. Our food then enters our stomach. Our stomach contains hydrochloric acid, and an enzyme called pepsin. The hydrochloric acid will kill bacteria in our food, while the enzyme pepsin will break down protein into amino acids. Note that the difference between pepsin and trypsin is that: pepsin is found in the stomach and works best in low pH solution, while trypsin is found in the pancreatic juice and works best in higher pH solution.</li>
          <li>Small Intestine. The small intestine is where fats(lipids), and other undigested food will be (fats only: emulsified) broken into its simpler substances. Here, the pancreas will send pancreatic juice which contains enzymes that will break food into simple substances that will then be absorbed. The absorbed food will enter the bloodstream and transported to the places of need. </li>
          <li>Pancreas, Liver, Gall Blader. The pancreas produces pancreatic juice which contains enzymes such as: trypsin, maltase, and lipas. The liver also plays a key role in the digestion of fat. It produces bile which will emusify (increase the surface area) fat. This bile will then be stored in the gall bladder which will secrete in when the food enters the small intestine</li>
          <li>Large Intestine. In the large intestine, absorption of water from undigested food will happen. Then it will be removed through the anus.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Types Of Digestion</h2>
        <ul class="outer">
          <li>Mechanical Digestion
            <p>Mechanical digestion happens at the mouth. Your teeth will chew the food and mechanically break it down into smaller pieces.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Chemical Digestion
            <p>Chemical digestion happens when enzymes break the food into simple substaces.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Enzymes
            <p>Like previously discussed in chapter 5, enzymes are biological catalyst. The enzymes that helps us with our digestion is: amylase, maltase, protease, lipase. <br><br> The amylase will break down carbohydrates into maltose. The maltase will then break down maltose into glucose. <br><br> The protease which includes pepsin and trypsin will break down protein into amino acids. <br><br> The lipase which is produced in the pancrease is used to break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Malnutrion & Deficiency</h2>
        <ul class="outer">
          <li>Constipation - happens due to the lack of fibre. This will lead to pain in the abdominal area. To prevent this, drink more water and consumer more vegetables</li>
          <li>Obesity - happens because of eating too much (usually fatty food). THhis may cause coronary heart disease, stroke and other diseases </li>
          <li>Coronary heart disease - happens because of eating too much food that contains cholesterol. Cholesterol will block the cor0nary artery and may result in heart attack if untreated. Prevention: eat less saturated fat, and food high in cholesterol.</li>
          <li>Scurvy - happens due to the lack of vitamin C, this will cause the bone to bend and bleeding under the gums. In children: stunted grwoth. Prevention: eat more citrust fruits</li>
          <li>Anemia - lack of iron. This will cause tiredness. Prevention: eat more red meat and dark vegetables</li>
          <li>Kwashiorkor - lack of protein over a long period of time. Causes stunted growth in children. To prevent this, eat more protein.</li>
