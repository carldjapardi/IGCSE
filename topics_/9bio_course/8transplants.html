        <h1>Transport In Plants</h1>
        <h2>1. Plant transport system</h2>
        <ul class="outer">
          <li><strong>Xylem :</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>A xylem vessel is made of many hollow, dead cells, joined end to end.</li>
              <li>The end walls of the cells have and formed a long, open tube.</li>
              <li>Xylem vessels run from the roots of the plant, right up through the stem and branch out into every leaf.</li>
              <li>Xylem vessels contain no cytoplasm or nuclei. Their walls are made of cellulose and lignin. Lignin is very strong, so xylem vessels help to keep plants upright.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Phloem</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Phloem tubes are made of many cells joined end to end. Their end walls have not completely broken down. Instead they form sieve plates which have small holes in them.</li>
              <li>The cells are called sieve tube elements which contain cytoplasm, but no nucleus. They do not have lignin in their cell walls.</li>
              <li>Each sieve tube element has a companion cell next to it.</li>
              <li>The companion cell does have a nucleus, and also contains many other organelles. Companion cells probably supply sieve tube elements with some of their requirements.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>2. Water uptake</strong></h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>Plants take in water from the soil through their root hairs.</li>
            <li>At the very tip of the end of a root is a root cap which is a layer of cells which protects the root as it grows through the soil.The rest of the root is covered by a layer of cells called epidermis.</li>
            <li>The root hairs are a little way up from the root tip. Each root hair is a long epidermal cell.</li>
            <li>Root hairs do not live for very long time. They are replaced by new ones as the root grows.</li>
            <li>Water moves into a root hair by osmosis as the cytoplasm and cell sap inside it are quite concentrated solution.</li>
            <li>Water travels by osmosis through the cortex, from cell to cell. Some of it seep through the space between the cells, or through the cell walls. Eventually, it reaches the xylem vessels in the middle of the root. These transport it all the way up through the stem and into the leaves. The pressure at the top of the vessels is lowered (because of transpiration) while the pressure at the bottom stays high. Water therefore flows up the xylem vessels.</li>
          </ul>
        <h2><strong>3. Transpiration</strong></h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>Transpiration is the loss of water from plant leaves by evaporation of water at the surfaces of the mesophyll cells followed by loss of water vapour through the stomata.</li>
            <li>Mesophyll cells inside the leaf are each covered with a thin film of moisture.</li>
            <li>Some of this film of moisture evaporates from the cells, and this water vapour diffuses out of the leaf through stomata.</li>
            <li>Water from the xylem vessels will replace it.</li>
            <li>Water is constantly being taken from the top of the xylem vessels to supply the cells in the leaves. This reduces the effective pressure at the top of the xylem vessels, so that water flows up of them. This process is known as transpiration system.</li>
            <li>Water potential gradient :
              <ul style="padding-bottom:15px;">
                <li>The low water potential in the leaves is caused by the loss of water vapour from the leaves by transpiration. This produces a &lsquo;pull&rsquo; from above, drawing water up the plant.</li>
                <li>Water molecules have a strong tendency to stik together called cohesion. When water is &lsquo;pulled&rsquo; up the xylem vessels, the whole columnn of water stays together.</li>
                <li>The structure of plants adpated to help it to take up water and move it up :
                  <ul style="padding-bottom:0px;">
                    <li>huge surface area of the root hair cells.</li>
                    <li>the hollow, narrow xylem vessels provide an easy pathway for water to flow all the way up.</li>
                    <li>many air spaces inside the leaf means that there is a large surface area of wet cells from which water can evaporate into into the air. The rate of evaporation increases; drawing more water out of the xylem and speeding up the flow of water up the plant.</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom:0px;">The stomata, when open, allow water vapour to diffuse easily out of the leaf, which reduces the water potential inside the leaf and encourages more water to evaporate from the surfaces of the mesophyll cells.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Measuring transpiration rate</li>
            <li>The rate at which a plant takes up water depends on the rate of transpiration.</li>
            <li>The apparatus which can be used to compare the rate of transpiration is a potometer. By recording how fast the air / water meniscus moves along the capillary tube, how fast the plant takes up water in different conditions can be compared.</li>
            <li>Conditions that affect transpiration rate :
              <ul>
                <li>Temperature : Transpiration increases as temperature inreases.</li>
                <li>Humidity : Transpiration decreases as humidity increases.</li>
                <li>Wind speed : Transpiration increases as wind speed increases.</li>
                <li>Light intensity : In bright sunlight, a plant may open its stomata to supply plenty of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. More water can therefore evaporate from the leaves.</li>
                <li>Water supply : Transpiration decreases when water supply decreases below a certain level.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Transpiration is useful for plants, because it keeps water moving up the xylem vessels and evaporation helps to cool the leaves.</li>
            <li>If the leaves lose too much water, the roots may not be able to take up enough to replace it. The plant wilts because the cells lose water by osmosis and become flaccid.</li>
            <li>Minerals salts are in the form of ions dissolved in the water in the soil. They travel to the xylem vesels along with the water absorbed and are transported to all parts of the plant by active transport.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>4. Transport of manufacture food</h2>
          <ul class="outer">
            <li>Translocation is the movement of sucrose and amino acids in the phloem, from regions of production (source) to regions of storage, or to region of utilisation in respiration or growth (sink)</li>
            <li>Carbohydrates made by photosynthesis is used to make amino acids, protein, oils and other organic substances.</li>
            <li>Some of the organic food material, especially sugar, is transported in the phloem tubes. The sap inside the phloem tubes therefore contains a lot of sugar, particularly sucrose.</li>
            <li>Sources and sinks :
              <ul>
                <li>The part of a plant from which sucrose and amino acids are being translocated is called a source.</li>
                <li>The part of a plant to which they are being translocated is called a sink.</li>
                <li>Sucrose is carried to all other parts of plant (the sinks) &ndash; include :</li>
                <li>the roots &ndash; change some of the sucrose to starch and store it.</li>
                <li>the flowers &ndash; use the sucrose to make fructose to produce sweet, juicy fruits to attract animals.</li>
                <li>Dormant plants plant survive on their stored starch, oils and other materials. When the seasons change, they begin to grow again. Now the stored materials are converted to sucrose and transported to the growing regions.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
