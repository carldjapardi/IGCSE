        <li>Egestion and excretion - Egestion is the removal of undigested matter from the alimentary canal. Egested material is not a product of metabolic processes, since it has not been absorbed into the cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> 2. Nitrogenous waste</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>Nitrogenous waste is formed from excess proteins and amino acids.</li>
        <li>Excess proteins and amino acids are broken down to form of nitrogen &ndash; containing excretory product, in mammals, this substance is mainly urea.</li>
        <li>Urea is formed in the liver and a toxic substance.</li>
        <li>Urea is removed from the body by kidneys.</li>
        <li>Amino acids are absorbed into the blood capillaries in the villi of ileum. The blood capillaries all join up to the hepatic portal vein, which takes the absorbed food to the liver.</li>
        <li>If the amino acids are more than needed, enzymes in the liver split up each amino acid molecule. The part containing energy is kept, turned into carbohydrate and stored. The rest which is the part that contains nitrogen, is turned into urea. This process is called <strong>deamination</strong>. Deamination is the removal of the nitrogen &ndash; containing part of amino acids to form urea.</li>
        <li>The urea dissolves into the blood plasma, and is taken to the kidneys to be excreted. A small amount is also excreted in sweat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Functions of liver</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>converts excess amino acids into urea and carbohydrates, in a process called <strong>deamination</strong>.</li>
        <li>Synthesis plasma proteins such as fibrinogen, from amino acids.</li>
        <li>Controls the amount of glucose in the blood, with the aid of the hormones insulin and glucagon.</li>
        <li>Store carbohydrate as the polysaccharide glycogen.</li>
        <li>Makes bile</li>
        <li>Break down old red blood cells, storing the iron and excreting the remains of the haemoglobin as bile pigments.</li>
        <li>Breaks down harmful substances such as alcohol</li>
        <li>Stores vitamin A, B, D, E and K</li>
        <li>Stores potassium</li>
        <li>Makes cholesterol, which is needed to make and repair cell membranes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. The human excretory system</h2>
        <p>The human urinary system is made up of a pair of kidneys and ureters, the urinary bladder and the urethra.</p>
        <p><img src="blob:https://wordhtml.com/e08ac72d-8f27-4d92-a1fb-8b55f3f12ee6" alt="pastedGraphic.png" /></p>
        <h2>The kidneys</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>The longitudinal section through a kidney shows</li>
        <li><strong>cortex</strong> &ndash; the outer region, which is protected by renal capsule</li>
        <li><strong>medulla</strong> &ndash; the inner region, which leads to the <strong>renal pelvis</strong>.</li>
        <li>The medulla consists of conical structures called pyramids.</li>
        <li>The pyramids each contain numerous <strong>nephrons</strong>, which are basic functional units of a kidney.</li>
        <li>Nephrons are surrounded by blood vessels and held together by connective tissue.</li>
        <li>A nephron consists of the following structures :</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><img src="blob:https://wordhtml.com/6d01a9a1-c4db-4115-a4ef-f180acc692f3" alt="pastedGraphic_1.png" /></h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>Leading from the pelvis is a tube, called the <strong>ureter</strong>. The ureter carries urine that the kidney has made to the bladder.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Kidney tubules</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>Kidney are made up of thousands of tiny tubules, or nephrons.</li>
        <li>Each tubule begins in the cortex, loops down to medulla, back into cortex and goes down again through medulla to the pelvis. In the pelvis, the tubules join up with the ureter.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Urine formation</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>As blood passes through the kidneys, it is filtered.</li>
        <li>It removes most of the urea and also excess water and salts.</li>
        <li>As liquid moves through the kidneys, any glucose in it is reabsorbed back into the blood. Most of the water is also reabsorbed along with some of the salts.</li>
        <li>The final liquid produced by the kidneys is a solution of urea and salts in water. It is called urine.</li>
        <li>The kidneys adjust the amount of urine produced according to the needs of the body. If the body is short of water, the kidneys produce small amount volume of concentrated urine. If the body contains too much water, the kidneys produce large volume of dilute urine, which helps to get rid of the excess water.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Filtration</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>Blood is brought to the renal capsule in a branch of the renal artery.</li>
        <li>Small molecules, including water and most of the substances dissolved in it, are squeezed out of the blood into the renal capsule.</li>
        <li>There are thousands of renal capsules in the cortex of each kidney. It has a network of capillaries called a glomerulus, in the middle.</li>
        <li>The blood in the glomerulus cannot get away easily as the blood vessel bringing blood to each glomerulus if quite wide but the one taking blood away is narrow. Quite a high blood pressure builds up, squeezing the blood in the glomerulus agaist the capillary walls.</li>
        <li>These walls have small holes in them. So do the walls of the renal capsules. Any molecules small enough to go through these holes will be squeezed through, into the space of renal capsule.</li>
        <li>Water, salt, glucose and urea can go through. Most proteins molecules are too big, so they stay in the blood, along with the blood cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reabsorption</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>The fluid in the renal capsule is a solution of glucose, salts and urea, dissolved in water. Some of the substances in this fluid are need by the body.</li>
        <li>All of the glucose, some of the water and some of the salts need to be kept in the blood.</li>
        <li>Wrapped around each kidney tubule are blood capillaries. Useful substances from the fluid in the kidney tubule are reabsorbed, and pass into the blood in these capillaries.</li>
        <li>The remaining fluid continues on its way along the tubule. By the time it gets to the collecting duct, it is mostly water, with urea and salts dissolved in it. It is called urine.</li>
        <li>The kidneys are extremely efficient at reabsorbing water. Over 99% of the water entering tubules is reabsorbed.</li>
        <li>In humans, the two kidneys filter about 170 dm<sup>3</sup> of water per day, yet only about 1.5 dm<sup>3</sup> of urine are produced in the same period.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The bladder</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>The urine from all the tubules in the kidneys flows into the ureters.</li>
        <li>The ureters take it to the bladder.</li>
        <li>The bladder stores urine. It has stretchy walls, so that it can hold quite large quantities.</li>
        <li>Leading out the bladder is a tube called the urethra.</li>
        <li>There is a sphincter muscle at the top of the urethra, which is usually tightly closed.</li>
        <li>When the bladder is full, the sphincter muscle opens so that the urine flows along the urethra and out of the body.</li>
        <li>Adult mammals can control this sphincter muscle consciously.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Kidney dialysis</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>Kidney failure refers to the inability of the kidney to function properly, causing the accumulation of excretory products in the blood.</li>
        <li>Kidney failure may be caused by the following :
        <ul>
        <li>hypertension</li>
        <li>complication from surgery</li>
        <li>diabetes</li>
        <li>severe bacterial infection or injury</li>
        <li>excessive alcohol intake</li>
        <li>drug overdose</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When both kidneys fail to function, the person will need to get a kidney transplant or undergo dialysis.&nbsp;The dialysis machine has the following properties :
        <ul>
        <li>The dialysis tubing is long, narrow and coiled. It is also partially permeable.</li>
        <li>This increases its surface area to volume ratio, thus increasing the rate of exchange of substances.</li>
        <li>Small molecules, such as urea and mineral salts, can diffuse through the tubing, but blood cells and protein will be retained in the blood.</li>
        <li>The dialysis fluid is a sterile solution that contains the same concentration of useful substance (e.g sugars, amino acids and mineral salts) as blood.</li>
        <li>This prevents the diffusion of these constituents of blood (unless in excess) from the blood plasma into the dialysis fluid.</li>
        <li>Metabolic waste products are absent from the dialysis fluid.</li>
        <li>This establishes a concentration gradient, which allows excretory products diffuse into the dialysis fluid for removal.</li>
        <li>The dialysis fluids flows in the opposite direction to the flow of blood.</li>
        <li>This maintains the concentration gradient across the membrane for the removal of waste products.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul  class='outer'>
        <li>Patients need to be treated on a dialysis unit two or three times a week, and the treatment lasts for several hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Kidney transplant</h2>
        <ul class='outer'>
        <li>The person receiving the transplant is the recipient, and the person from whose body the organ was taken is the donor.</li>
        <li>Problems with transplant operations &ndash; the recipient&rsquo;s immune system recognises the donor organ as being &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; and attack it. This is called rejection. The recipient is given drugs called immunosuppresants which stop the white blood cells working efficiently, to decrease the chances of rejection. The trouble with immunosuppressants is that they stop the immune system from doing its normal job, so the person is more likely to suffer from infectious diseases.</li>
        <li>The chances of rejection are reduced if the donor is a close relative of the recipient.</li>
        </ul>
